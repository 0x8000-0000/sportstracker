SportsTracker
=============

SportsTracker is an application for people who want to record their
sporting activities. It is not bound to a specific kind of sport, the user
can create categories for all sport types such as cycling, running, 
swimming or tennis.

The main advantage is a good overview of your exercises and you can easily
create diagrams and statistics for specific time ranges and sport types. In 
the calendar you can also track your body weight or create note entries, e.g. 
the training plan or upcoming sport events.

All the application data is stored in XML files. So it should be easy to
access it with other tools or to write importers and exporters for other
applications.

If you own a heartrate monitor with a computer interface you can display
the recorded exercise files and evaluate the diagrams with the integrated
ExerciseViewer application. 
You can organize them by attaching the recorded files to the exercise 
entries. When adding new exercises you can import the data from the 
recorded exercise files.

Further informations can be found in the file [README.txt]
(sportstracker/docs/README.txt).
