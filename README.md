## SportsTracker

SportsTracker is an application for people who want to record their sporting
activities. It is not bound to a specific kind of sport, the user can create
categories for all sport types such as cycling, running, swimming or tennis.

The main advantage is a good overview of your exercises, you can easily create
diagrams and statistics for specific time ranges and sport types. In the 
calendar you can also track your body weight or create note entries, e.g. the
training plan or upcoming sport events.

All the application data is stored in XML files. So it should be easy to access
it with other tools or to write importers and exporters for other applications.

If you own a heartrate monitor with a computer interface you can import the
recorded exercise files and evaluate the diagrams with the integrated
ExerciseViewer application.
