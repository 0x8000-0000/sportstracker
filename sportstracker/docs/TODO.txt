SportsTracker-TODO
==================

Current GPS support implementation (prototype):
-----------------------------------------------
- What's done:
  - Position class stores the GPS location data, is an optional atty in ExerciseSample
  - GarminTcxParser: parses and stores the GPS location data (Position), incl. checks in unit tests
  - EVExercise.RecordMode has now a location-flag, it's true when GPS data is available
  - added new TrackPanel (named "Track") to ExerciseViewer
  - TrackPanel displays the track in a map component (JXMapKit with OpenStreetMap backend) 
  - TrackPanel displays a label for missing data if track data is not available 
- TODOs:
  - If a GPS data is in an external file, then store the data in EVExercise.Track class (optional)
    - Track has 1..n TrackPoints
    - TrackPoint has the attys:
      - Timestamp
      - Position
      - Comment
  - the TrackViewer in ExerciseViewer decides which position data must be displayed
  - add to CHANGES.txt and documentation in README.txt

GPS track data and viewer support - OLD DESIGN:
---------------------------------------------------
- Exercise object: Add optional trackFile attribut, similar to hrmFile
- ExerciseDialog:
  - Add below HRM file selection an optional GPS track file selection entry and file chooser button.
  - Rename "View HRM file" button to "View exercise details".
- New TrackViewer subproject, similar to ExerciseViewer.
  - It contains the TrackViewer widget, which will be displayed as an extra tab in ExerciseViewer
    (new last tab "Track" or "Map").
  - It contains parsers for different track file formats, e.g. GPX, KML, ....
    The parser list must use the ServiceLoader API to be extensible (similar to
    ExerciseParser in ExerciseViewer)
  - The LocationParser must return a Track object which contains a list of
    all parsed trackpoints. Each TrackPoint has these attys:
    - latitude: double (degrees)
    - longitude: double (degrees)
    - timestamp (optional)
    - comment (optional, e.g. for Lap split names)
  - The TrackViewer subproject MUST NOT have any dependencies to SportsTracker
    or ExerciseViewer classes! Only ExerciseViewer uses the TrackViewer classes!
- ExerciseViewer:
  - PVExercise class: add new optional property "track" of type Track (see above)
  - PV gets the hrm filename on startup and the optional track filename.
  - GPS Track data can also be part of the hrm file (e.g. in Garmin TCX format), then only
    the HRM filename will be passed on ExerciseViewer startup.
  - ExerciseViewer parses the GPS track data if available and stores it in the PVExercise object,
    which will then be displayed.
  - The new "Track" tab displays the track data of the exercise, if available.
  - ExerciseViewer must be able to display the Track data only, when the user does not has a HRM file.
- GarminTcxParser: add suport for parsing track data


General TODOs:
--------------
- Closing dialog with Escape key doesn't work when a JXDatePicker has the focus
- "Copy exercise" feature, see request:
  https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=2927194&group_id=133110&atid=726273
- Exercise Dialog (and all others): use JFormatedTextField for entering
  distance, duration etc.
- Exercise list view: right mouse click on the column header should open the
  Options Dialog tab for the list view
- translation updates (german, french and czech are up to date)
- close all dialogs with the Escape key => see TaskList application
- manual starting of Tasks (background) will be simpler in future AFW's,
  improve STController:startActionManually() then
  => https://appframework.dev.java.net/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=39
  => http://kenai.com/jira/browse/BSAF-92 (I've created a new issue in BSAF)
- Batch import for multiple exercise files (e.g. when migrating from Windows 
  Polar software): In the Import dialog the user needs to select the the sport 
  type, the subtype, the intensity and which value from distance, AVG speed or 
  duration needs to be recalculated (because these 3 values in the exercise 
  files does not fit together in most cases) first. Then all selected files 
  will be imported as exercises into SportsTracker. 
- FilterDialog should also make possible to show e.g. all bicycle
  sport subtypes, except those from "ergometer" (hint from Steffen Rehn)

Calendar view/widget:
- horizontal or vertical animation for scrolling through the months
  => create bitmaps of old and new month view and move those (much faster)
  => alternative: fade out and in via alpha channel
- draw small shadows?


Training route/lap support:
- requested by Bernd Mirbach and other users, see mail from Bernd:
- we need a dialog for editing possible routes/laps and the appropriate
  length, ascent and description
- the user can select a predefined route in the exercise dialog and
  the appropriate widgets will be pre-filled
- it should be possible to filter for specific routes for evaluation


ExerciseViewer-TODO
===================

Diagram panel:
- there's no space at the left side when the bottom axis displays "by distance"
  (between left axis and graph start)

ExerciseParsers:
- GarminTcxParser:
  - refactor big method parseExercisePath(...), split into multiple methods
- PolarHsrRawParser and PolarSRawParser:
  - Refactor: Extract duplicate methods/code
- HAC4 Parser:
  - more exercise data checks for parser in unit tests
- HRM Parser: 
  - recalculate average heartrate, speed, times within ranges ... from samples,
    there are often wrong values in the appropriate HRM fields (hint from 
    Steffen Rehn) - (Polar Windows software seems to recalculate this too :-)
  - When the monitor displays heartrate and ranges in percent instead in bpm
    the heartrate limit ranges in the HRM files are also stored in percent. 
    But it's not possible yet to determine whether it's bpm (default) or 
    percent. That's why the parses always assumes bpm values.
    (Calculate the BPM values with help of max. heartrate should work ...)
