Development Notes
==================

XMLStorage notes:
- the storage uses JDOM 1.1, the performance is fast enough => reading of 1400 
  exercises takes about 0.5 sec incl. validation (when using the client JVM)
- use of StAX (or StAX2) doesn't make sense, the speed with validation is the
  same as with JDOM and schema validation is very tricky in StAX(2)
