IDE Configuration
=================

All SportsTracker developers should use the same coding style and format. The
main benefits of a consistent code format are:

* code is easier to read
* less problems when merging files
* code reviews contain just the feature changes, 
  not tons of custom formatting changes

Most IDE's provide tools to ensure a consistent code format. For SportsTracker
there is an Eclipse Formatter configuration (ST-Formatter.xml) and an Organize
Imports configuration (ST-Imports.importorder).
These configurations can be used in Eclipse and in IntelliJ IDEA.

Developers should configure their IDE's as described below and always format
their code changes by using the formatter and the imports organizer. Only the
modified source code parts needs to be formatted, not the whole files or 
packages.
